<h3><font size="4" face="arial" color="blue">HI im Nithin and today im gonna tell you the places i visited in the summer holidays.So first i went to a summer camp for 1 month July-August and in thursday i use to have a swimming session and we used to go to the country club for the sessions and we used to have karate,kickboxing,art,clay works and many more and altough i was known as the eldest in it and it was not much fun for me cuz i need to lose in every single game or anything in it so the kids can win and be happy and i was ok with it i left because i didnt like staying with all those kids,and in August 6 i went to Ferrari world and it was a lot of fun and i experience the worlds fastest roller coaster Formula rossa and Flying aces and etc... and it was very good,and after that at August 12 i went to Warner Bros it was all super fun all the virtual reality systems were fun like the 3d screen stuff and 7D screens seats which will take us up and give us the real feeling that how it is and all over it was super good and in the mean time i use to do my homework like this one  and of course i enjoyed my summer holidays by exploring Abu Dhabi for the first time.</h3>
